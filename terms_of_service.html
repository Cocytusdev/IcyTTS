    <ol>
      <li><strong>Free version:</strong> includes banner and rewarded ads, up to 3 quick-phrase slots, handwriting recognition, stroke color selection, local TTS voice selection, speech rate control, and basic image import.</li>
      <li><strong>Premium version (IcyTTS Premium):</strong> removes all ads, expands to 10 quick-phrase slots, enables premium voice catalogs, and grants access to future features.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using IcyTTS, you agree to these Terms of Use (“Terms”). If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Access and Registration</h2>
    <p><strong>Free installation:</strong> IcyTTS is available at no cost on Google Play. Premium features require an in-app purchase through Google Play Billing.</p>
    <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Android 6.0 or higher; for premium voice catalog fetching and ads, a network connection is needed.</p>
    <p><strong>Google Account:</strong> Not required for core features, but necessary to complete in-app purchases.</p>

      <li>The App itself does not process refunds; exceptions follow Google’s guidelines.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.5 Restoration of Prior Purchases</h3>
